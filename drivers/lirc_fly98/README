FlyVideo 98 IR remote control driver

YOU NEED 2.2.x KERNEL TO USE THIS DRIVER.

This driver should support lirc interface in LIRC_MODE_CODE mode.
This is not fully tested yet. The lirc_fly98.c file should be compiled
as a kernel module ad you should apply included patch to the bttv-0.6.3
driver tree (not the kernel bttv driver). You can get alternative patch
at http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/~jochym/FlyVideo98/

There is also a patch for a kernel bttv driver. This one is better tested
now since I switched my machine to this driver (works better). 
bttv patch will be better tested and corrected later.

For examples of config files see remotes/fly98 directory.

To install:

 - apply the proper patch from drivers/lirc_fly98 
 - compile the kernel (turn ON BT848 and FlyVideo98 remote support)
 - run autogen.sh
 - run setup.sh from main directory and configure the fly98 driver 
 - run configure, run make 
 - run make install or 
    copy lirc_fly98.o to /lib/modules/2.2.10/misc (or similar) and 
    run depmod
 - copy lircd.conf and lircmd.conf from remotes/live-view to /usr/local/etc 
   and lircrc to ~/.lircrc 
 - you should be ready now
