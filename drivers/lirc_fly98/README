FlyVideo 98 IR remote control driver

This driver should support lirc interface in LIRC_MODE_CODE mode.
This is not fully tested yet. The lirc_fly98.c file should be compiled
as a kernel module ad you should apply included patch to the bttv-0.6.3
driver tree (not the kernel bttv driver). You can get alternative patch
at http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/~jochym/FlyVideo98/

There is also a patch for a kernel bttv driver. This one is better tested
now since I switched my machine to this driver (works better). 
bttv patch will be better tested and corrected later.

Remember to set KERNEL_SRC in Makefile.am before runing autogen !

For examples of config files see remotes/fly98 directory.
