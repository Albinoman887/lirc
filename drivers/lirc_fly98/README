FlyVideo 98 IR remote control driver

YOU NEED 2.2.x KERNEL TO USE THIS DRIVER.

This driver should support lirc interface in LIRC_MODE_CODE mode.
This is working on my home system. No reports of problems so far.

The lirc_fly98.c file should be compiled as a kernel module and 
you should apply included patch to the kernel tree. The patch for
version 2.2.11 kernel should apply cleanly up to version 2.2.13.
For 2.2.14 and up it needs small modifications. I'll produce 2.2.14 and
2.2.15 patches soon.

There is also a patch for an external bttv driver in old version (0.6.3). 
This one is not tested now since I switched my machine to kernel bttv driver 
(works better). External bttv patch will be better tested and corrected later.

For examples of config files see remotes/life-view directory.

To install:

 - apply the proper patch from drivers/lirc_fly98/patches 
 - compile the kernel (turn ON BT848 and FlyVideo98 remote support)
 - run autogen.sh
 - run setup.sh from main directory and configure the fly98 driver 
 - run configure, run make 
 - run make install or 
    copy lirc_fly98.o to /lib/modules/2.2.10/misc (or similar) and 
    run depmod
 - copy lircd.conf and lircmd.conf from remotes/live-view to /usr/local/etc 
   and lircrc to ~/.lircrc 
 - you should be ready now
