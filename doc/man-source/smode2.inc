[DESCRIPTION]

smode2 uses the svgalib to show the IR waveform in a graphical
representation. The time division is variable from 1 ms/unit to
extremely high values (integer type) but there is no point increasing
this value above 20 ms/unit, because one pulse is about 1 ms. This kind
of presentation is much more exciting than the simple pulse&space output
showed by mode2.
