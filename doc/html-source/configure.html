<P>TODO</P>

<P>IMPS/2 Protocol ?</P>

<P>Configure X11 (or any other mouse using program) to use it as a mouse
   in MousesSystems mode.</P>

<P>Stick this section in your XF86Config file to use the mouse in addition
   to your normal one.</P>

<PRE>    Section "XInput"
        Subsection "Mouse"
            Protocol    "MouseSystems"
            Device      "/dev/lircm"
            DeviceName  "Remote"
            AlwaysCore
        EndSubsection 
    EndSection</PRE>

<P>Be sure you use a current version of X11. There seems to be a bug in X
   version 3.3 that can make X crash if you use both mouse and remote
   control mouse simultanously. At least I coulndn't reproduce this with
   other versions.</P>

<P>You can also e.g. use multimouse (available at 
   <A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/"><U>ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/</U></A> or
   mirrors) or gpm to use it parallel to your normal mouse. With: 
   <B>gpm -t ms -R -M -m /dev/lircm -t msc</B></P>

<P>I can use my glidepad (Microsoft protocol) and my remote control
   (MouseSystems protocol) at the same time to control the mouse pointer.</P>

<P><B>NOTE:</B> If you update /etc/lircmd.conf you can send the signal HUP
   to lircmd. This instructs lircmd to reread its config file.
   <B>killall -HUP lircmd</B>. Or get the process number with <B>ps x</B>
   and try <B>kill -HUP lircmd-process-number</B>. The same is true for
   lircd if you change /etc/lircd.conf. lircd will also reopen
   its logfile on SIGHUP.</P>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The lircmd.conf file format</H1>
<HR WIDTH="70%">

<P>The config file for lircmd is quit simple. Just look at the example.
Change the values at the <B>ACCELERATOR</B> directive if your mouse pointer
is moving too fast/slow. I recommend that you use a special button to
activate the mouse daemon (<B>ACTIVATE</B> directive). You will see it whenever
the daemon is activated/deactivated directly on the screen.
'*' is allowed as wildcard for button and remote. Please note that
every line that fits to the received signal will be executed. Parsing
starts at the top of the file.</P>

<P>See also <B>contrib/lircmd.conf</B>.</P>




    <!-- .lircrc fileformat ------------------------------------------------->

<A NAME="lircrc_format"><HR></A>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The .lircrc file format</H1>
<HR WIDTH="70%">

<P>Ok if all looks ok, all what you need now are the
tools, which react on the keycodes decoded by lircd. To do this you need
a file called .lircrc. This should be placed in your home directory.</P>

<P>First I will explain the syntax of the .lircrc file itself.
The config file for lirc tools consists of one or more of the
following constuctions:</P>
<PRE>    begin
	prog	= ...
	remote	= ...
	button	= ...
	repeat	= ...
	config	= ...
	mode	= ...
	flags	= ...
    end</PRE>

<DL>
<DT>prog</DT>
<DD>gives the name of the program that should receive the config
    string given in config.
</DD>
<DT>remote, button</DT>
<DD>specify a key of a remote control that lauches
    an action. Key sequences can be specified by giving more then
    one remote/button string. The character '*' can be used as a
    wildcard for remote or button. The default for remote is '*'.
</DD>
<DT>repeat</DT>
<DD>tells the program what shall happen if a key is repeated.
    A value of zero tells the program to ignore repeated keys.
    Any other positive value 'n' tells the program to pass the config
    string every 'n'-th time to the according application, when a key is
    repeated. The default for rep is zero.
</DD>
<DT>config</DT>
<DD>is the string that will be passed to the according application
    whenever the specified key sequence is received by lircd. If you
    give more than one config string, the config strings will be passed
    to the applications by turns. With this feature you can for example
    implement toggle buttons.
</DD>
<DT>mode</DT>
<DD>tells the program to enter a special mode.
    You can group several configurations by putting them into the
    following, where mode stands for the mode where these configurations
    should be active:
</DD>
</DL>

<PRE>    begin mode
	...
    end mode</PRE>

The following are valid flags:
<DL>
<DT>once</DT>
<DD>This is only allowed in conjunction with the mode directive.
    The config string is passed to the application only
    the first time the mode is entered or you have
    explicitly left this mode. This is useful for starting
    an application whenever you enter a special mode.
</DD>
<DT>quit</DT>
<DD>Usually all configurations are examined if they have
    to be executed. You can stop this immediatly with this flag.
</DD>
<DT>mode</DT>
<DD>This is only allowed within a mode block. It tells the
    program to leave this mode.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>Ok now a simple example for a <B>.lircrc</B> file (supposed you use an AnimaX
   remote and use the sample files for this remote from the remotes/
   directory. If you have another remote change <B>remote=</B> and <B>button=</B> according
   to your remote [this definitions are made in the /etc/lircd.conf file] )</P>

<PRE>    begin
        remote = ANIMAX
        button = MENU_DOWN
        prog   = irexec
        repeat = 0
        config = echo "hello"
    end</PRE>

<P>If you have saved this as <B>.lircrc</B> in your homedir, start 
<B>irexec</B>. Press the button which is selected in the
<B>button =</B> line and you will see a
'hello' on your screen. As you can see irexec is a simple 
program launcher. Of course you can do a lot more than just start
programs.</P>
