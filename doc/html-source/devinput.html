		    <P>
		      Usually you don't have to create a config file
		      yourself if you use this driver as this <A
		      HREF="http://linux.bytesex.org/v4l2/faq.html#lircd">generic
		      config file</A> should already contain all
		      existing keys.
		    </P>
		    <P>
		      This driver uses <em>/dev/input/event0</em> as
		      its input device per default. You should provide
		      the correct device as --device parameter on the
		      lircd and irrecord command line.
		    </P>
		    
		    <P>
		      Sometime the input device mapping changes
		      between system reboots. In that case you are
		      also able to specify the correct input device by
		      its name or physical location by preceding the
		      desired value with <em>name=</em> or
		      <em>phys=</em>.  Shell wild-cards can be used
		      for the given value but must be protected from
		      the shell with proper quoting.
      		    </P>

		    <P>
		      For example you can use:
      		    </P>
<PRE>
--device=name='Budget-CI dvb ir *'
--device=phys='pci*/ir0'
</PRE>

		    <P>
		      With the following script you can list all names
		      associated with all existing Linux input
		      devices.
      		    </P>
<PRE>
for i in /sys/class/input/input* ; do echo -n "$(basename "$i"): "; cat "$i/name"; done
</PRE>
		    <P>
      		      This information also can be found in
      		      <em>/proc/bus/input/devices</em>.
      		    </P>
