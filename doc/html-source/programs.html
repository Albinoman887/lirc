<P>
The main task of lircd is to decode the infrared signals and provide
an uniform interface for client applications. Clients can connect to
lircd through a Unix domain socket which is located in
<em>/dev/lircd</em>. Using this socket they will get the infrared
codes received by lircd and they can send commands to lircd.
</P>

<P>
The config file for lircd is located in
<em>/usr/local/etc/lircd.conf</EM>. lircd has its own logfile in
<em>/var/log/lircd</em>. You can make lircd reread its config file and
reopen its logfile by sending the HUP signal to the program. That way
you can rotate old logfiles.

<P>This daemon can simulate a MouseSystems or IMPS/2 type mouse. It
gets the received buttons from lircd and converts it into mouse
events. To make this possible, lircmd needs a config file located in
<em>/usr/local/etc/lircmd.conf</em>. In this file you have to
determine which button from which remote causes a mouse move or a
mouse button click.
</P>

<P>
lircmd will use syslogd to output error messages. It depends on your
system configuration where they will show up.

<A NAME="daemons"><P><B>Usage of the Daemons</B></P></A>

<P>
lircd and lircmd are daemons.  You should start them in some init
script depending on your system.  There are some example sripts for
different distributions in the <em>contrib</em> directory. lircmd has
to be started after lircd as it connects to the socket lircd provides.
</P>

<P>
If you start lircd or lircmd from your shell prompt you will usually
get back immediately to the prompt. Often people think that the
program has died. But this is not an error. lircd and lircmd are
daemons. Daemons always run in background.

<PRE>
  <B>irexec</B> [config file]
</PRE>

<P>This program lets you execute arbitrary commands on an IR signal
decoded by lircd, the LIRC daemon. You can give irexec a command line
parameter which has to be a name of a valid config file. If no command
line parameters are given irexec reads the default config file which
is usually ~/.lircrc.  If irexec executes a program it will wait until
this program terminates. So append a '&' to the command string if you
don't want that.

<P>The config string consists of the command to be run.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> If you start irexec, it reads your <A
HREF="configure.html#lircrc_format">~/.lircrc</A> and reacts only on
<TT>prog=</TT> entries that point to irexec. If you have included more
than one program in your .lircrc, then start all these programs, they
react itself only to their according entries in .lircrc.</P>

<P>irpty connects to lircd to receive infra-red codes and converts
them to key strokes. E.g., type <em>irpty ~/.lircrc workbone</em> to
control the CD-player program workbone. Of couse you will have to
create an appropriate config file for this purpose first.  The config
string will be passed to the desired application.</P>
