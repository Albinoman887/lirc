<P>This daemon behaves like a MouseSystems Mouse. It gets the received
buttons from lircd and convert it into mouse moves. To make this
possible, lircmd needs a config file. In this file you have to say
which button from which remote causes a mouse move or a mouse
button click. Read also the <A HREF="#daemons"><U>daemon note</U></A>.</P>




<A NAME="daemons"><P><B>Usage of the Daemons</B></P></A>

<P>
lircd and lircmd are daemons.  You should start them in some init
script depending on your system.  There are some example sripts for
different distributions in the <em>contrib</em> directory.
</P>

<P>
lircd has its own logfile in <em>/var/log/lircd</em>. lircmd will use syslogd
to output error messages. It depends on your system configuration
where they will show up.
</P>

<P>
lircd and lircmd will reread their config files if they receive the
HUP signal. Additionally lircd will reopen its logfile so that you can
remove old logfiles.
