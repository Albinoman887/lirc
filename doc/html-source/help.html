<P>
The following description was written having receivers in mind that
deliver IR signals as pulses and spaces. So some of this will not be
relevant for receivers that work at a higher abstraction layer as
<NOBR>e.g.</NOBR> the Irman or TV card receivers. 
</P>

<P>
There already is a growing database of config files for remote
controls available at the LIRC homepage. But if your remote control is
not available yet you can use <em>irrecord</em> to create a config
file for your remote control.  If you want to use more than one remote
control you have to create a separate file for each remote. If your
remote control is able to control different devices it is often wise
to create separate config files for each functional unit of the remote
control.  You can later use a single config file for <em>lircd</em> by
simply merging the config files with <NOBR><em>cat config1 config2
&gt;lircd.conf</em> </NOBR>.<BR>
</P>

<P>
Before using <em>irrecord</em> you should start <em>mode2</em> and
have a look at the signals that your receiver supplies. If you can see 
random pulses without pushing any buttons of your remote control your
receiver is picking up ambient light. So if your receiver has no
ambient light filter try to add one. A good strategy might also be to
create a config file in a dark room and to turn off all fluorescent
lamps or any other devices that may cause IR noise.
</P>

<P>
If decoding of IR commands does not work reliably you can try to
modify the <em>eps</em> and <em>aeps</em> values in the lircd config
file to adjust the tolerance of signal lengths. <em>aeps</em> is an
absolute value while <em>eps</em> is a relative value expressed in
percent. Also if repeats do not work you should complain. I.e. if you
hold down a button the output of <em>irw</em> should look like this.

Note how the second field gets incremented. Many people don't event
notice if this does not work correctly.

<P>
As creating new config files is difficult sometimes and irrecord often
cannot detect all features of the remote control please send new
config files to <A
HREF="mailto:lirc@bartelmus.de">lirc@bartelmus.de</A>. Other people
will appreciate this very much. Sometimes they cannot create such a
config file themselves because their original remote control is broken
or has been lost. Some devices that are capable of IR come without a
remote control. Some people also only want to build a transmitter and
if you make a config file available for them they won't need to build
a receiver, too. Please add all information you can get concerning the
remote control as a comment to the config file.
</P>

<P>
If you still have difficulties to create a working config file send
the following information to <A
HREF="mailto:lirc@bartelmus.de">lirc@bartelmus.de</A>:

<UL>
<LI>version of LIRC that you are using<BR>

  Check if you are using the current version and if there already is a
  config file for your remote control.</LI>

<LI>description of your problem</LI>

<LI>config file created by irrecord, if available</LI>

<LI>output of irrecord in <em>DEBUG mode</em> (you can compile LIRC in

  DEBUG mode by selecting this feature in the <em>Software
  configuration</em> section of the setup program or by adding
  <em>--enable-debug</em> to the configure script command line)</LI>

<LI>output of mode2<BR>

  Make sure you hold down some buttons for a while so that repeat
  codes will be visible. Do NOT edit this output. Just send it to
  me!</LI>

</UL>

I won't be able to answer any emails that do not contain the necessary
information!
